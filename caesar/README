The intent behind this code is to use the classic Caesar shift to find if there are any words that can be shifted to form another valid word. I hypothesized that I could generate a lexicon of words that would yield two or more intelligible results from the same ciphertext, which would confuse codebreakers to which message is authentic and which is a red herring. There are very few that qualify, so this experiment yielded nothing significant to report.

The numbers for letters correspond to A = 1, B = 2, etc. The spacebar, when experimenting with lines of prose rather than individual words, was assigned the number zero.

The Caesar cipher might be the most familiar and easiest to break of all ciphers. Having a sort of superposition to the plaintext would have given it some effectiveness. As it stands, I recommend you never use it to conceal any information that you would actually want to keep secret.
